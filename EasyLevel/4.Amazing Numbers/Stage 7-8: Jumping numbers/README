Stage 7/8: Jumping numbers
Description
A number is a Jumping number if the adjacent digits inside the number differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is not considered as 1. Single-digit numbers are considered Jumping numbers. For example, 78987, and 4343456 are Jumping numbers, but 796 and 89098 are not.

In this stage, we will also remove the limitation on pending properties in a request. The program knows how to calculate ten properties of numbers, and it would be strange to limit the query to just two properties. Let's remove this limitation. Let the program indicate all properties for all numbers in the request.

Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1.Welcome users;
2.Display the instructions;
3.Ask for a request;
4.If a user enters zero, terminate the program;
5.If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
6.If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
7.For one number, print the properties of the number;
8.For two numbers, print the list of numbers with their properties.
9.For two numbers and properties, print the numbers with the specified properties;
10.If a user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user;
11.Once a request has been processed, continue execution from step 3.

In the current stage, the property names include even, odd, buzz, duck, palindromic, gapful, spy, square, sunny, and jumping. The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like.

Instructions
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:
  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be printed;
- two natural numbers and properties to search for;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.
Error messages
The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.
The second parameter should be a natural number.
The property [SUN] is wrong.
Available properties: [EVEN, ODD, BUZZ, DUCK, PALINDROMIC, GAPFUL, SPY, SQUARE, SUNNY, JUMPING]
The properties [HOT, SUN] are wrong.
Available properties: [EVEN, ODD, BUZZ, DUCK, PALINDROMIC, GAPFUL, SPY, SQUARE, SUNNY, JUMPING]
The request contains mutually exclusive properties: [SQUARE, SUNNY]
There are no numbers with these properties.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
