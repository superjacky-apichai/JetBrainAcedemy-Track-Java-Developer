Stage 4/5: Signs of intelligence
Description
Let's write the medium difficulty level now. To do this, we need to add awareness to our AI.

This level will be a lot harder to beat than easy, even though the initial moves are still random. When the AI is playing at medium level, it wins when it can because of its first rule, and stops all simple attempts to beat it due to its second.

You can see these rules below.

Objectives
When the AI is playing at medium difficulty level, it makes moves using the following logic:

1.If it already has two in a row and can win with one further move, it does so.
2.If its opponent can win with one move, it plays the move necessary to block this.
3.Otherwise, it makes a random move.

You should add a medium parameter so that you can play against this level. It should also be possible to make AIs using easy and medium levels play against each other!

Example
The example below shows how your program should work.
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
